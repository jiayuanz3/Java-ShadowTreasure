# ShadowTreasure

This is a piece work from Swen20003 Object Oriented Software Development Project(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 05/2021 with Jave programming.

In this Project, I implement a ShadowTreasure game. The player moves to the nearest sandwich if the energy level is below the threshold and moves towards the zombie otherwise. The goal is to achieve the treasure in the end. 

src folder contains all Jave codes, res folder has all resource image and font, test folder owns the test cases. 

Note: Bagel is utilized in the project. It is developed by the tutor from the University of Melbourne. Documentation here: https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mcmurtrye/bagel-doc/.
